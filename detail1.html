							<h2>Blessed Me With My Sweet Baby Girl</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My story begins when I got married to the love of my life. Our priority was to settle down first and then bring a child into our lives.

When we tried to have a baby, however, somehow things did not work out. So we decided to visit the doctor, who advised us to take certain tests. We went through a lot of medical treatments but were unable to find the reason for not conceiving.

Our parents, relatives, neighbors, and friends were asking for the news of a baby, and we had nothing to report. My married friends were being blessed with children, and there I was depressed and anxious.

One day my doctor said that if I didn’t conceive by the end of the year, I would have to start IVF treatment. That was devastating news. The treatment was very expensive, and there was no assurance that it would succeed on the first attempt. Then one of my close friends insisted I consult an astrologist, whose advice might be helpful.

My husband and I made an appointment, and that meeting changed my life. We explained our health problem to the astrologist, who asked me if I had watched The Secret. I said I had. In fact, I had seen it several years before. “So,” the astrologist said, “if you already know The Secret, why are you coming to me with your problem? You can solve it on your own.” He guided us on how to use The Secret, and on that very day, I promised myself that I had the right to conceive naturally.

From then on, my husband and I incorporated The Secret into our routine.

First I bought the book and read it carefully. After reading it, I thanked God whenever I saw a pregnant woman, for the very sight of her. I started buying clothes for my baby girl. I collected pictures of the baby’s growth and saved them on my cell phone. I started using baby soap. I made a place for my child’s clothes in my cupboard. Each day my husband and I thanked God for our cute angel. Whenever my relatives asked me about good news, I told them, “Very soon,” with a smile on my face. I was doing this as if our little angel had already arrived.

Nine months after starting to practice The Secret, I took a home pregnancy test that came out positive. I had conceived without any medical intervention.

I had tears rolling down my cheeks! I was super-happy. My husband was happy too, that I had conceived without any medical treatment. My entire pregnancy went very smoothly, and nine months later, we were blessed with a sweet and healthy baby girl. Many people had been telling me it would be a boy, but I knew even before conceiving that I would be blessed with a baby girl.

So, to anyone who is having trouble conceiving, I just want to say, never lose hope and be positive. Just ask the Universe and believe that you have already received and you will be blessed with everything you wish for!</p>
